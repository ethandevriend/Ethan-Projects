I am using the normal version of the rules. I changed them a bit to when you get
a full hand of 14 cards you automatically lose. This was to help with the fact that a hand could 
only fit so many slots with the GUI I was trying to implement.


Important notes


- Sometimes the opponents hand will not graphically update after their turn or after they draw and it will look like a
turn was skipped. However it was not.

- I cut the size of the deck from 104 to 56 since its two player. There were too many times no one could make a play. I achieved this by making it
so that the deck only has 1 of each number and action card except for wild.

- I worked the best I could given my stability

- the hand you or the computer getting is being given by a shuffled deck. its just good or bad luck for you both.

- I hope you do enjoy the game though, I think its somewhat cool.
